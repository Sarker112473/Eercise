# Eercise
Physical rehabilitation is a critical process for improving patient recovery after injuries or surgeries.
Computer-aided assessment of physical rehabilitation entails evaluation of patient performance in completing exercises.
I applied three models to develop and compare deep learning models for predicting physical rehabilitation assessment scores.
Used dataset :  MobiPhysio
Selected deep learning models for experiment:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)
3D-CNN+LSTM hybrid model (CONV3D)
There are 9 types of exercise in dataset .
Each type or each class contains 80 videos.
